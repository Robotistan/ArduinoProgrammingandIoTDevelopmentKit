# What We'll Learn
-  We will understand the working logic of the DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor and the ESP8266 WI-FI sensor and use them in our projects.  
-  We will write the code in the Arduino IDE environment, with the circuit diagram that transfers the temperature and humidity data we receive thanks to the DHT11 sensor to the internet environment thanks to the ESP8266 WI-FI sensor.

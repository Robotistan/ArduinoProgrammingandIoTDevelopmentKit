# What We'll Learn
- The aim of this week is to enable students to understand the working principles of the diode using the Arduino UNO microcontroller and to make connections to the gate     circuits, which is one  the basic concepts in digital electronics, and to program this circuit as desired with the Arduino IDE software. 
- Then, it is aimed to develop the software foundations by designing more complex LED and RGB LED circuits and programming them with Arduino IDE.

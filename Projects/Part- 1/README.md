## What We'll Learn
- The aim of this week is to enable students to understand the working principles of basic electronic circuit elements such as resistors and LEDs using the Arduino UNO microcontroller, and to make the connections of these elements using a breadboard and to program this circuit as desired with the Arduino IDE software. 
- In the following processes, it is aimed to use other circuit elements and to form the basis of connection skills during the preparation of complex circuits.

# What We'll Learn
-  We will learn to develop a project by understanding the working logic of the SD card module and infrared sensor. We will also learn to write the necessary code lines by using the mobile robot platform that we have installed before and the infrared sensor together, establishing the circuit that detects the line and moves the motors systematically according to the values it detects.

Thanks to the developing technology opportunities, the importance of programming education is increasing day by day. In this context, electronic or robotic programming concepts have become frequently used in educational environments and educational activities have begun to be carried out in this field. These educational activities have been prepared at a level that will appeal to students of all education levels. We, as Robotistan team, aimed to help high school students learn sensor technologies and take a step towards electronic programming. We aim to make these contents useful to everyone and facilitate your learning process and enable you to make projects quickly. For set contents, applications, videos and any suggestions and questions you may have, you can send them to us via the e-mail address "info@robotistan.com".
